The TypeScript `match` expression
Feb 8, 2026

Rust's match expression is amazing. It was inspired by ML family languages like Haskell and OCaml, and languages like Zig and Swift
are also adopting it. Then I look at the go-to scripting language, TypeScript, and think: "Man, if only TypeScript had this".
Well, it sort of does, with 50-year old C-style switch statements. But these have many flaws, with not being expressions
one of them.

EDIT: Haskell is actually not an ML-family language, but it was inspired by them

So, why not create a match expression in TypeScript? Here is some mockup syntax:
\codeblock(ts){
const a = "hello";

const b = match(a, {
    "hello": () => 7,
    "world": () => 42,
})

console.log(b) // Output: 7
}

I find this syntax kind of close to Rust, with the =>.
The reason it uses functions and not direct values is that sometimes some additional info may be passed into the function,
like with Rust enum destructuring, though that is for another day.
